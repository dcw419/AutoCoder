# AutoCoder
This repository contains GitHub Actions configurations and scripts to interact with ChatGPT.

🧠 Project Overview: AutoCoder
AutoCoder is a practical GitHub Actions project that teaches you how to build a reusable workflow powered by generative AI. This project focuses on automating code generation and integrating it into your development pipeline using GitHub Actions and OpenAI's API.

🚀 Objectives
Create a reusable GitHub Action that can be used across multiple repositories to automate coding tasks.

Integrate with OpenAI's API to generate code using natural language prompts.

Streamline development workflows by automating code generation, committing, and reviewing through GitHub Actions.

🛠️ What You’ll Build
A fully functional GitHub Actions workflow file (.yml) with custom steps.

An action that interacts with the OpenAI API to generate code based on commit messages or file instructions.

An automated system that responds to repository changes by generating or updating files.

📚 What You’ll Learn
How to write and configure GitHub Actions from scratch.

How to securely use secrets and environment variables.

How to send HTTP requests and handle API responses within an action.

How to integrate generative AI into your development process.

🎯 Outcome
By the end of this project, you’ll have hands-on experience building intelligent CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions and OpenAI. You’ll walk away with a practical tool you can reuse, customize, and integrate into your future projects.
